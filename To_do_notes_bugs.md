# Notes
**How to render the website locally:**
1. Open Mac terminal
2. define working directory `cd /Users/alexanderdalheimer/Documents/GitHub/adalheimer.github.io`
3. Run `bundle install` in the terminal which looks at the gemfile in the folder and basically downloads everything
4. Execute Jekyll `bundle exec jekyll serve` which looks at all html, markdown and css files and combines them to one website
